Create a grid with the speculative listing of items (e.g. cards with properties, events, items in the store, members of the team and so on).

Card (aka component) should contain following information:
[Optional] Image (use placeholders, e.g. [https://placehold.co/](https://placehold.co/))
Title
Short description (1-2 sentences)
Link(s) or button(s)
Icon to mark item as a favourite
[Optional] Any additional information that might be relevant for your speculative use case (e.g. rating, list of icon list to social channels and so on)

Listing should:
be responsive and layout of the components should adjust as well when needed.
contain 3+ cards to reflect the responsive behaviour of the layout.

Your demo page should explicitly contain a variant of the card when the item is added to favourite.

## Bonuses

Card should have a hover effect with use of animation
Create one more variant for a featured item in the list. E.g. it takes up more space, has more prominent typography and different color schemes.
